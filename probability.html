        I'm guessing that you are in school or are just bored. I made this entire thing for you guys. To be honest, I hate how school tech administration makes our digital life feel like China. And Securly? @?$! them. They have done nothing good for us. Frankly, this whole Zany Math thing is probably going to get blocked before we know it. So I want you guys to abuse the heck out of this. Try to get in trouble. And ask to go see an admin. Tell them that they need to give us back our freedom, our lifeblood. Because even though they don't want us on our devices abusing them, everything that we do in school is on the devices. What else are we supposed to do? <br> Now, please enjoy all the things I have provided for you while they last. And thank you for joining my cause.
